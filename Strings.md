By assigning a number to a variable, the variable automatically has the type Number.
We can use the typeof operator to find out the type of a value or variable. 
```
console.log(typeof 1);
const num = 1;
console.log(typeof num);
# returns *number number*
```
We can also assign a text to a variable:
```
const text = 'hello';
console.log(text);
```
There are different ways to assign a text to a variable:
```
let text = "hello";
console.log(text);
text = 'hi';
console.log(text);
text = `bye`;
console.log(text);
```
All those ways are correct, and string type.
